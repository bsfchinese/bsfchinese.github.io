>What would your daily life be like without things built by others? Our cultures, family histories, educational systems and job markets are a few things we depend on that others began long ago. Often, life goes on as usual in relation to the people and things around us. But, sometimes a pioneer explores new places on earth, builds inventions or leads social changes that launch entirely new periods of human history.

>The church is this type of ongoing pioneer endeavor. Jesus Christ said, “I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.” 1 He calls His Church to represent His coming kingdom everywhere until He returns. The proper biblical training and church experiences we enjoy tie us directly to these first faithful apostles, disciples and missionaries like Paul and Barnabas.

**The Second Division of Acts**

Acts 13 introduces the Holy Spirit’s next initiatives in God’s plan for Jesus Christ’s Church. 3 Since the Day of Pentecost, the Spirit spread the church in Jerusalem, all Judea and Samaria. The Spirit had displayed His indwelling power in salvation of Jews and God-fearing Gentiles.

+ Church planting moves from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
+ Church expansion moves from Peter to Paul.

Several points help us see how the Spirit moved Paul into his role as apostle to the Gentiles. 4 
+ Paul’s call to his first missionary journey was at least 11 years into his active, faithful ministry. 
+ Paul’s journeys total 10 to 13 years of his overall ministry. 
+ Paul’s journeys were filled with practical and spiritual challenges and provisions.

**The Beginning of the Missionary Movement – Acts 13:1-4**

Luke records five “prophets and teachers” as church leaders at Antioch in Syria. They depended on the Holy Spirit to serve the people. The congregation flourished as they preached, taught and directed. Their names and this local church’s reputation show Jesus Christ’s purposes for His Church. Every local church is to serve as the Spirit-filled, physically present body of Christ showing God’s kingdom to
