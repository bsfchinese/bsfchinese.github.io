>What would your daily life be like without things built by others? Our cultures, family histories, educational systems and job markets are a few things we depend on that others began long ago. Often, life goes on as usual in relation to the people and things around us. But, sometimes a pioneer explores new places on earth, builds inventions or leads social changes that launch entirely new periods of human history.
>
>The church is this type of ongoing pioneer endeavor. Jesus Christ said, “I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.” (Gates of Hades: [Matthew 16:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Matthew+16%3A18&qs_version=CUVMPT)) He calls His Church to represent His coming kingdom everywhere until He returns. The proper biblical training and church experiences we enjoy tie us directly to these first faithful apostles, disciples and missionaries like Paul and Barnabas. The Spirit still calls modern believers to venture by faith into spiritual and physical struggles to see others live in God’s love and light. (Spiritual struggles: [Ephesians 6:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Ephesians+6%3A12&qs_version=CUVMPT)) In light of Acts 13-14, how much are you willing to sacrifice that others may know the Lord Jesus as Savior?

## The Spirit Initiates Missions – Acts 13:1-4

**The Second Division of Acts**

Acts 13 introduces the Holy Spirit’s next initiatives in God’s plan for Jesus Christ’s Church. (Jesus’ commands: [Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Matthew+28%3A18-20%3B+Acts+1%3A8&qs_version=CUVMPT)) Since the Day of Pentecost, the Spirit spread the church in Jerusalem, all Judea and Samaria. The Spirit had displayed His indwelling power in salvation of Jews and God-fearing Gentiles.

Now, chapters 13 and 14 show three main shifts emphasized in the rest of Acts. 
+ Gospel preaching moves from the Jews to Gentiles. 
+ Church planting moves from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
+ Church expansion moves from Peter to Paul. 

**The Three Great Missionary Journeys of Acts**

Several points help us see how the Spirit moved Paul into his role as apostle to the Gentiles. (Saul’s conversion and calling: [Acts 9:1-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Acts+9%3A1-16&qs_version=CUVMPT))
+ Paul’s call to his first missionary journey was at least 11 years into his active, faithful ministry. 
+ Paul’s journeys total 10 to 13 years of his overall ministry. 
+ Paul’s journeys were filled with practical and spiritual challenges and provisions.

**The Beginning of the Missionary Movement – Acts 13:1-4**

Luke records five “prophets and teachers” as church leaders at Antioch in Syria. They depended on the Holy Spirit to serve the people. The congregation flourished as they preached, taught and directed. Their names and this local church’s reputation show Jesus Christ’s purposes for His Church. Every local church is to serve as the Spirit-filled, physically present body of Christ showing God’s kingdom to the world. 
+ They embraced unity in Christ among diverse abilities, ethnicities and socio-economic standings. (Antioch’s diversity: [Acts 11:19-26; 13:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Acts+11%3A19-26%3B+13%3A1&qs_version=CUVMPT))
+ They showed the love of Christ that conquers fears, prejudices, hatred, sins and evil. 
+ They shared the light of Christ that conquers darkness and confusion. 
+ They displayed supernatural new life in Christ that conquers old ways, death and hopelessness. 

**The Spirit reproduced Christ’s love among them for those trapped in sin and spiritual darkness**. They worshipped, fasted and prayed. They asked the Holy Spirit to show them how to share the gospel. The Spirit called them to send Paul and Barnabas. They were the first missionaries to purposely go to a new place to share the gospel with all people they encountered. They and their helper, John Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, specifically planned to minister to foreign, idolatrous Gentiles. (Barnabas: [Acts 4:36-37; 11:22, 25-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Acts+4%3A36-37%3B+11%3A22,+25-26&qs_version=CUVMPT)) The people were grateful to be used by God to form new churches despite great cost to themselves. 

**Paul’s First Mission – Acts 13:5-14:21**

These suggestions may help you more fully engage in this first missionary journey. 
+ Locate each place on the map. Each place was visited twice, except Derbe and Cyprus. 
+ Visualize the missionaries’ encounters. The first stops in each place focused on evangelism. They proclaimed the good news in faith that the Spirit would give many new lives in Christ. The return stops in each place on their way home focused on confirming new Christians in their faith and appointing leaders. 
+ Remember this entire trip was by sea or on foot. The missionaries walked more than 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) on mountainous roads. Romans counted 16 miles (25 kilometers) average walking for one day. 
+ Paul and Barnabas were missionaries between two and three years before returning to Antioch church. Estimated dates are between AD 48-49. 

**Mission in Cyprus — Acts 13:5-12**

**Salamis – 13:5**

Barnabas’s love for his homeland and people made Cyprus a good first stop. The missionaries likely departed in March at the start of the navigation season for the 130-mile (209 km) trip. They came into the harbor of Salamis. It was the largest city. They preached to Jews in synagogues. Luke records no response. They walked 100 miles (161 km) to Paphos.

**Paphos – 13:6-12**

Like many modern cities, Paphos was known for shameless immorality, idolatry and occult superstitions. God responded to its people’s darkness, impurity and demonic activity with grace. He sent His Spirit and Word to the people. God offered His gospel in the lives of these missionaries. How is God’s love reflected in your prayers, attitudes and reactions to ungodliness?

The city’s Roman leader, Sergius Paulus, was eager to hear the gospel. But he also depended on the advice and sorcery of a Jewish false prophet called Elymas. He sought to prevent the leader’s conversion. The Spirit showed His power through Paul to overcome Satan’s evil power in Elymas. Instead of blocking God’s work, Elymas’ blindness caused the leader to believe. No one can stop an eternal work of our sovereign God. 

**Mission in Pisidian Antioch – Acts 13:13-52**

Paul’s choice of Pisidian Antioch is unsurprising. He focused on strategic centers of worldwide influence. This city (not the same as Antioch in Syria) was the nerve center of Asia Minor. All lines of communication radiated from this hub. This effort promised widespread spiritual results worth facing the dangers to arrive.

**John Mark’s desertion – 13:13-14**

On the way, John Mark quit and returned home. God’s Word gives no reason. Speculations center on concerns that cause many Christians to fail by never starting to serve God in the first place. Was Mark homesick? Was he too uncomfortable among Gentiles in foreign cultures? Was he afraid of hardships and dangers? Whatever reason, John Mark failed in this mission.

However, life in Christ means failure is not fatal to faith. The Spirit finishes what He starts. (Spirit finishes work: [Philippians 1:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Philippians+1%3A6&qs_version=CUVMPT)) John Mark joined Barnabas on later missions. Still later, Paul commended him as a faithful fellow worker. (John Mark: [Colossians 4:10; 2 Timothy 4:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Colossians+4%3A10%3B+2+Timothy+4%3A11&qs_version=CUVMPT)) God chose Mark to write the Gospel that most clearly reveals Jesus Christ as God’s servant, who “did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many .” (Servant: [Mark 10:45](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Mark+10%3A45&qs_version=CUVMPT)) Further, Peter called Mark “my son,” suggesting he, too, was a mentor to Mark. (Mentor: [1 Peter 5:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=1+Peter+5%3A13&qs_version=CUVMPT))

God never quit shaping John Mark into a sacrificial servant. God will not quit on you. Have you failed to accept or keep a commitment? Do not lean on your excuses or reasons. Lean on God’s promise to restore you. Confess your weakness. Accept the Spirit’s power to produce strength in its place. (Spirit’s power: [Ephesians 3:16; Colossians 1:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Ephesians+3%3A16%3B+Colossians+1%3A11&qs_version=CUVMPT)) Humbly step forward in faith to restore trust in relationships and to serve others for Jesus. 

**Paul’s First Recorded Sermon – 13:15-41**

The Spirit also shaped Paul for God’s calling. He used Paul’s education by the famous rabbi Gamaliel and all his other experiences. Paul worshipped as he taught with passion, wisdom and reason. Paul also established a pattern of going first to the synagogue. There, the people – both Jews and God-fearing Gentiles – would know God’s story and promises of salvation.

Paul’s pattern is effective today:
+ **Paul identifies with the people and their experiences**. Paul uses God’s Word to reaffirm what they believed. They knew God historically worked among His covenant people to provide deliverance from bondage and forgiveness for disobedience.
+ **Paul introduces Jesus Christ and His gospel into their experiences**. All Jewish history leads to David’s greater Son, the God-man Christ Jesus. Paul emphasizes Christ’s cross forgives sin. His resurrection proves God’s power to deliver believers from sin into new life. Like Peter, Paul uses Scriptures to prove fulfillment of prophecy.
+ **Paul urges those hearing to receive Jesus Christ’s salvation**. Paul appeals to his audience, and to you today. God justifies all who believe by grace through faith that Jesus Christ died in our place and was resurrected as proof and our promise of eternal life. God gives this faith as a gift. No efforts, choice of the will, law-keeping or moral standard makes us right with God. (Faith not works: [Ephesians 2:8-10; Romans 3:23; 9:16; James 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Ephesians+2%3A8-10%3B+Romans+3%3A23%3B+9%3A16%3B+James+2%3A10&qs_version=CUVMPT)) Faith involves repentance, the reorientation of life to fully trust the real but currently invisible Lord Jesus Christ. 

**Ministry Sparks Persecution – 13:42-52**

Paul and Barnabas encouraged those who believed “to continue in the grace of God.” This means to act on what we now understand to learn more. The gospel spread across the city. The next Sabbath, envious Jews opposed Paul’s teaching. Satan’s evil is behind all efforts to keep God’s truth from those who need Jesus. 

The missionaries confronted their opponents’ sin against God. Paul announced God’s command for ministry to focus on Gentiles. The Spirit’s new initiative toward Gentiles fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. (Gentile inclusion: [Genesis 12:3; Isaiah 52:13-15; 56:6-7; 60:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Genesis+12%3A3%3B+Isaiah+52%3A13-15%3B+56%3A6-7%3B+60%3A3&qs_version=CUVMPT)) God confirmed this shift when they witnessed the Spirit’s outpouring on these Gentiles. The gospel message was received with tremendous joy. 

Paul also identified himself and his missionary companions as servants who bring light to the Gentiles. (Servant: [Isaiah 49:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Isaiah+49%3A6&qs_version=CUVMPT)) This has powerful implications for the Church as the body of Christ as Paul fulfills the Christlike role of servant by preaching to the Gentiles. 

Jewish men and women caused political leaders to expel Paul and Barnabas. The cultural act to “shake the dust from their feet” (Shake dust: [Luke 10:10–11](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Luke+10%3A10–11&qs_version=CUVMPT)) symbolized the Jewish persecutors were rejected for their rejection of Jesus, their Messiah. The Antioch converts saw that trials, conflict and even persecution accompany entrance to God’s kingdom. Yet, supernatural joy and transformation as new creations by the Holy Spirit outweighed any opposition. Difficulties deepen spiritual roots and confirm Christ’s power to prevail in every situation. (Aroma of Christ: [2 Corinthians 2:14-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=2+Corinthians+2%3A14-16&qs_version=CUVMPT)) 

**Mission in Iconium – Acts 14:1-14:7**

Paul and Barnabas walked the new Roman road toward Lystra. They turned left to visit Iconium . The 85-mile (137- km) journey was less strenuous than the climb of 4,000 feet (1,200 m) from Perga to Pisidian Antioch. Their mission already involved humiliation and suffering, but also the Spirit’s amazing productivity.

Iconium, in present-day Turkey, was a beautiful city set among farms and orchards. God caused His devoted, persecuted servants to experience an outpouring of His good provisions there. God authenticated His servants’ words by miracles through them like He had done with Peter. 

There are five points to notice in their pioneering visit to Iconium:
+ A multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed.
+ Unbelieving Jews turned Gentiles against them.
+ They stayed a long time to encourage new converts.
+ The entire city divided between those who supported and opposed Jesus Christ and His messengers.
+ The missionaries wisely fled their enemies’ murderous plot. 17 

**Mission in Lystra – Acts 14:8-20**

Unlike Iconium, Luke reports very few Jews and no synagogue in Lystra. The Gentiles spoke some Greek, but mostly “the speech of Lycaonia,” unknown to the missionaries. This is where Paul connected with Timothy and his family. 18

**The healing of the disabled man – 14:8-10**

Peter had spoken by the Holy Spirit to heal the lame man in Jerusalem. 19 Now Paul commanded a man crippled from birth to stand. As he believed and obeyed, he miraculously received God’s healing. 

**The attempt to worship the apostles – 14:11-14**

The superstitious crowd shouted, “The gods have come down to us in human form !” They sought to offer sacrifices to Barnabas and Paul. The missionaries knew worship only belongs to God. Yet, after their initial response of distress and profound grief, they showed compassion toward these confused unbelievers. Obviously, the crowd knew nothing of the Scriptures. Paul could not preach as he did to Jews. 

**Paul’s missionary appeal – 14:15-18**

Paul started where today’s missionaries to places of unbelief or among those denying the Creator God also begin.
+ Paul appeals to God-given conscience and reason in every person. 20
+ He reveals that God created all things. He points to evidences around them.
+ He speaks of God’s grace and kindness to provide for their needs.
+ He points out the true God is unlike the idols they worship in vain.
+ He calls for repentance – to turn from worship of “no-god” (empty things) to worship of the One living God.
+ He warns that God does not allow Gentiles to live by their own ideas without judgment. 21 

**Paulʼs stoning – 14:19**

Unbelieving Jews from Iconium and Pisidian Antioch arrived. They sought to destroy Paul’s ministry. They no doubt viewed it as a cult, a distortion of true Judaism. Their spiritual opposition persuaded many to reject God’s Word. Zeal to honor the men as gods turned into violence. Thinking they stoned Paul to death, they dragged him out of the city. Some think it was in this persecution when Paul experienced a vision of heaven he describes in 2 Corinthians 12: 1-4.

**Paulʼs recovery – 14:20**

Believers gathered around Paul. Possibly the group included Barnabas, Eunice , Lois, Timothy, the man Paul healed and other converts. Paul suddenly got up, like miraculous life from the dead.

From this experience, Paul drew such comfort and assurance of God’s care for him that later he was able to encourage others with power. 22 He went back into Lystra with strength from God. What a testimony of God’s power to new converts and to God’s enemies!

### Mission in Derbe – Acts 14:21

The next day Paul and Barnabas left to walk the 30 miles (48 km) to Derbe. It seems God said , “Time to rest from enemies!” They continued ministering in Derbe. They saw many come to faith with no record of conflicts or persecution. Gaius, Paul’s companion and fellow worker on a later journey, 23 was likely converted at this time. Gracious, loving, empathetic Paul drew people from all classes and places to Jesus Christ. Paul and Barnabas consistently showed triumph through the Spirit when suffering. No wonder new converts were willing to endure hardships for the name of Christ.

## Paul’s Return to Antioch – Acts 14:22-28

The shortest, easiest route home for the two missionaries was the imperial highway east then south to Syria. But Paul and Barnabas were true shepherds. They cared for the lambs left behind among wolves in Lystra, Iconium and Pisidian Antioch. They suffered much persecution themselves in all these places. 

Paul considered it impossible to return to Antioch in Syria without revisiting the new believers. It meant a longer and more dangerous return route to see the new converts firmly rooted in Christ. 24 Discipleship takes time. It also involves sacrifice and hardships for leaders. Yet eternal fruit comes through the suffering of the cross. 25 What people have gone the extra mile to firmly root you in Christ? How will you praise God for His love for you through them? How could you best thank them this week?

### Revisiting Cities Through Asia Minor – 14:21-25

Paul’s four aims in ministering to new converts still apply today.
+ Strengthen disciples in faith. Paul and Barnabas confirmed the disciples stood firmly by faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ. They were confirmed by their experience of the Holy Spirit’s enabling power and comforted by the expectancy of Christ’s return. Paul and Barnabas exhorted them to carry on in faith.
+ Prepare disciples for trials. Paul prepared these new Christians to expect trials. Trials accompany the joy of the goodness of Jesus Christ. 26 They had witnessed Paul and Barnabas embrace their glorious inheritance – the kingdom of God, while enduring trials. All believers must be willing to share our King’s temporary rejection in this world.
+ Establish disciples as a church. Gentile converts needed to follow the God-given pattern for forming local churches. Paul and Barnabas identified and trained each church’s leaders as shepherds under the Lord Jesus Christ. During these return visits, Paul and Barnabas appointed elders at a meeting of prayer and fasting in each place.
+ Commit disciples to the Lord. Paul and Barnabas did not know whether the Lord would ever lead them to return. How could these new Christians stand firm? They were spiritually immature and without New Testament writings. Yet, it was not Paul and Barnabas who had given them new life through salvation. The Lord Jesus Christ saves. They were His responsibility. He is able to keep His own in every circumstance. To say farewell is to commit “them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.” 

### Return to Antioch in Syria – 14:26-28

Paul and Barnabas had been away from their home church at Antioch in Syria for two or three years. The church sent them out to accomplish God’s work, which they had finished. God promises our labor will never be in vain when it is done for Him by faith in the power of the Holy Spirit. 27

The two reported the Spirit’s work to their fellow church members. They told about new opportunities to advance Christ’s church. Paul and Barnabas gave them spiritual vision for the power of the gospel to transform individuals throughout the whole world. 28 Paul and Barnabas stayed for a long time at Antioch for rest and recuperation. However, God had work for them at home, too. They led their local church members to fully embrace their inheritance in Christ.

Believers carry responsibilities to steward our inheritance well – in our church communities and by investing in the unreached people of the world.

## Take to Heart

>**Hold Fast**
>
>Acts 13 and 14 prove that speaking of Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit brings results. The Holy Spirit’s power is inseparable from His fruitful character. 29 We must speak the truth with grace and love. Believers love people by serving God in faith. We leave the results to Him. It is only by the power of the Holy Spirit that doubters become convinced that Jesus is the resurrected Savior and Lord. Sometimes, there are almost immediate conversions of those who have never heard the gospel. Often , individuals hear the truth of Jesus Christ numerous times over days, weeks or even years before they respond in faith.
>
>As the church at Antioch shows, hope is more than wishful thinking that someone , somewhere will be saved. We go and share the gospel with hope (certain trust) in God’s will and ability to save. God saves despite inevitable opposition by Satan. We love people in the power of the Holy Spirit to break down barriers. We are to persevere in prayer 30 and trust in God’s promises. 31
>
>Believers can expect God’s comfort in times of opposition and persecution. Sometimes Christ’s servants suffer intense spiritual opposition and physical persecution like Paul and Barnabas. But circumstances have no power to hinder what God plans for us to experience. Comfort comes through perseverance in the awareness of fellowship with Christ in His suffering. 32 Comfort comes as we find His strength is sufficient for any emergency or need. 33 Another comfort is the satisfaction of knowing that this kind of “death” produces “life” in others. 34
>
>God will perfectly provide periods of rest from opposition while we continue serving him. Derbe was such a season of respite and refreshment between trials. However, it was not a season of rest from ministering to others. If you are in the midst of a trial, take courage. Carry on and have faith that God will lift it in His time when His purposes have been accomplished . If there is no current opposition, carry on by making most of your opportunity to freely serve.
>
>**Apply**
>
>It Have you received justification ? This is to possess God’s forgiveness from your sin and Christ’s righteous standing by grace through faith. If not, today is the day the Spirit of God and the Word of God call you to come. 35 Justification is not earned by your good life.
>
>It arrives with believing the death, resurrection and exaltation of Jesus Christ won this for you. Do you believe in Him for new life? When you consider where God would have you take the gospel, do you focus on the spiritual opportunities or the potential physical costs? Loving people and speaking God’s truth through the power of the Spirit overcomes darkness and evil. First, have you started loving people and sharing truth right where God already has you? Next, will you pray and actively seek the next person, group or community that needs to see how Jesus Christ changes everything? It may be in a new city or with a group of people nearby in an age group, culture or religion completely foreign to you.
